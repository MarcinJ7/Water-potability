# Water-potability
Water potability classification project.

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability

In this project, the goal was to develop a predictive model capable of determining whether water is suitable for consumption or not, relying on specific parameters. By employing various machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, the project aimed to create a robust classifier. This classifier, utilizing input features such as pH levels, mineral content, and contamination indicators, would evaluate water samples and categorize them as potable (safe for drinking) or non-potable (unsafe for consumption).
